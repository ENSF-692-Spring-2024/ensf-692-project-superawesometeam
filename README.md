# ENSF 692 Spring 2024 - Group Project

# Group members: Bo Zheng Ma, Rick Zhang, Warisa Khaophong 


## Goals:
* Design and document a terminal-based Python application
* Select, import, and manipulate a set of data
* Merge multiple datasets using Pandas
* Use hierarchical indexing to sort and slice data
* Process data according to user input
* Operate on data in Pandas and NumPy
* Display data using Matplotlib
* Collaboration with other programmers

## Our selected datasets
* Number of Cellphones 
* Total Coal Consumption 
* ELectricity generated 
* Inflation annual percent 
* Daily income ($ earned/person on a daily basis)
* Life expentancy
* Net internet users
* Population
* Residential electricity use
* Total GDP USA (Inflation adjusted)

## How to run the program
* Clone the repository onto your local machine
* Ensure that python along with pandas are installed properly.
    * Change working directory to ensf-692-project-super-awesometeam
    * Run 692Project.py by typing: python 692Project.py

## Inputs
* The program will process datasets from 'src' folder and merge them into 'df_final.csv'

## Outputs
* The program will take in 'df_final.csv' and output pivot tables and final dataframe (with added columns) to 'output' folder.
* The plot png files will also be in 'output' folder
